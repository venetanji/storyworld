    Pace the story slowly and keep in mind where you are in the story arc:
    
    Act I: Departure (Stages 1-5)
    In this act you will introduce the characters and the world they live in.
    At the end of stage 5, the characters will be ready to embark on their journey.
    
    Act II: Initiation (Stages 6-11)
    In this act the characters will face challenges and grow as individuals.
    The most important part of this act is the climax, which will be at stage 9 and 10.

    as they now have mastered skills and knowledge that they did not have before.
